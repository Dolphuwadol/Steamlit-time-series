# Time Series App

In this project, I utilized Selenium to scape an overview of stock prices in the SET50 index, collecting both statistical and financial data 
- Employing EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) ,I specifically chose to analyze KBANK stock, and I conducted technical analysis and then applied time series techniques to forecast its stock prices.
- The models used include ARIMA, LightGBM regressor, and LSTM, with LSTM demonstrating the best predictive performance at an RMSE of 3.185.
- Finally, I deployed the ARIMA model on to a web application using Streamlit.
